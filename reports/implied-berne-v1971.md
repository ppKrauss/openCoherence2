*BY*   | Attribution | cite the licensor, ex. when permitted to use a fragment (ex. long quotation)
*NC*   | No Comercial use | can't do any commercial use of the work.
*ND*   | No Derivatives   | can't do derivative works from the work.
*SA*   | Share-alike      | when permited, the copies must preserve the same licence, but in a explicit way.
